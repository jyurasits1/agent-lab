Hey team, a few things piling up:

1. The mobile checkout flow has a bug where promo codes silently fail on orders over $200.
   Customers are complaining — Marcus flagged 3 support tickets this week. Needs a fix ASAP.

2. We promised the marketing team a CSV export for the campaign dashboard by end of Q1 (March 31).
   No one has picked this up yet.

3. Low priority but: the internal admin panel still shows deprecated API warnings on every page load.
   It's cosmetic but embarrassing when we demo to new hires. Fix when there's bandwidth.

4. Can someone write up a short runbook for the nightly data-sync job? It's failed twice and
   the on-call engineer had no idea how to restart it. No hard deadline but should happen soon.

Thanks
